	\section{Overview}
	 Digital Image Processing >> handling or Manipulation of digital images by computer.\\
	 Image processing include changing the nature of an image in order to : Improve its pictorial information for human interpretation and Render it more suitable for independent machine perception.\\
	 \section{What is Digital Image Processing}
	 Image : multidimensional function f(x,y) of spatial coordinates.\\
	 Spatial coordinate: (x,y) for 2D
	                     (x,y,z) for 3D
	                     (x,y,t) for movies \\
	 We call the image as a digital image When (x,y) and the amplitude values of f are
	 all finite "discrete quantities" .\\ 
	 Digital image processing : Processing of digital images on a digital computer.\\
